.. _Quick-Start-Guide:

**Welcome to THRUX!**

Use this guide to help set up your projects and navigate to common tasks.  

Supplement this with our :ref:`User Manual <User-Manual>` and our :ref:`FAQ's <Frequently-Asked-Questions>` for more information.

**Creating a New Project**
==========================

On the Home Screen, use the + button to create a new project.

.. image:: images/new_project-1.PNG
    :align: center

Enter a name for your project and select Start to load all of the default settings.  These settings can be modified at any time.

.. image:: images/new_project-2.PNG
    :align: center

**Defining Architectural Elements**
===================================

The goal of the Architectural Workspaces, :ref:`Arch. Elements <Arch.-Elements>` and :ref:`Floor Plans <Floor-Plans>`, is to provide a quick way for designers to mass the load of a building.  They aid with point-to-point calculations.

However, these workspaces are completely optional.  For a smaller project, you may not find it necessary to set up these workspaces, and find it faster to manually input feeder lengths in the :ref:`One-Line <One-Line>`.

Soon, this information will be imported from an Architectural Revit model.

Open the Floor Plans workspace by clicking on the icon on the left.

.. image:: images/floorplans-icon.PNG
    :align: center

A blank screen will be displayed because no Architectural Elements have been defined.

Creating Columns, Floors, and Rooms
-----------------------------------

Use the Setup Wizard on the right to start to create columns and floors.  Think of this as a skeleton to base your equipment locations.

.. image:: images/floorplans-2.PNG
    :align: center

.. image:: images/floorplans-3.PNG
    :align: center

In this example, we've created a 100 ft. by 100 ft. building which is 100 ft. tall.

.. image:: images/floorplans-4.PNG
    :align: center

Use the Grid Editor to modify columns, and Accept Changes when complete.

.. image:: images/floorplans-grid_editor.PNG
    :align: center

Create a Room by hovering over a column region.  We'll create a Utility Room or a service entrance room.

.. image:: images/floorplans-room-1.PNG
    :align: center

.. image:: images/floorplans-room-2.PNG
    :align: center

.. image:: images/floorplans-room-3.PNG
    :align: center

Create stacked Rooms in a common location as the building rises, by selecting multiple Floors, and adding a Room.  We'll create an electrical closet which spans the selected floors.

.. image:: images/floorplans-room-4.PNG
    :align: center

.. image:: images/floorplans-room-5.PNG
    :align: center

Similarly, while multiple floors are selected, create a Riser, which is a space dedicated for pipes to route between distribution nodes.

.. image:: images/floorplans-riser-1.PNG
    :align: center

.. image:: images/floorplans-riser-2.PNG
    :align: center

.. image:: images/floorplans-riser-3.PNG
    :align: center

We'll also create a room for a generator on the top Floor.

.. image:: images/floorplans-room-6.PNG
    :align: center

.. image:: images/floorplans-room-7.PNG
    :align: center

Now we have some base locations to place our equipment.  These Architectural Elements can be modified at any time in the :ref:`Arch. Elements <Arch.-Elements>` workspace.

.. image:: images/archelements-1.PNG
    :align: center

Here, you can modify other characteristics of a Floor.  For example, to mass the load of a building, we can assign a load requirement or load density to each floor.  This load is based off of the Floor's Space Type.

.. image:: images/archelements-2.PNG
    :align: center

The Space Types are customizable, and a set of default values are provided.  

Massing the Building Load
-------------------------

Now, we'll package all of the Architectural entities to calculate the load of the project.

Select all of the Floors and create a Package.

.. image:: images/archelements-building_load-1.PNG
    :align: center

.. image:: images/archelements-building_load-2.PNG
    :align: center

In addition to our Floor loads, we must account for the power requirements of mechanical equipment.  We can do this by modifying the Space Type, and also creating Load Allocation.

As an example, we're creating a Load Allocation which represents an AC Unit on each of the Office floors.

.. image:: images/archelements-building_load-3.PNG
    :align: center

Add this Load Allocation to the Package we created earlier, by clicking the + button, and selecting the Package.

.. image:: images/archelements-building_load-4.PNG
    :align: center

Switching back to the Arch. Package tab, we can see the total load of the building.

Now we're ready to build our electrical model.  Let's start in the :ref:`One-Line <One-Line>`.

**Building the One-Line**
=========================

Click the :ref:`One-Line <One-Line>` icon to open the workspace.  Power flow of your distribution system is shown from top to bottom.

.. image:: images/one-line-icon.PNG
    :align: center

.. image:: images/one-line-1.PNG
    :align: center

Setup Wizard - Creating Equipment
---------------------------------

Use the Setup Wizard to Create a Source, Distribution Equipment, and Loads.  By default, the source voltage is 480 V.

.. image:: images/one-line-2.PNG
    :align: center

.. image:: images/one-line-3.PNG
    :align: center

Selected equipment will be denoted by a purple circle, with additional options to Add, Copy, Paste, Delete, and Navigate to other workspaces.

    :align: center

.. image:: images/one-line-5.PNG
    :align: center

.. image:: images/one-line-6.PNG
    :align: center

Rehosting Equipment
-------------------

To attach a load, to rehost, or to change the source of an equipment, you can drag and drop the load to its source.

.. image:: images/one-line-rehost-1.PNG
    :align: center

.. image:: images/one-line-rehost-2.PNG
    :align: center

Connect the rest of your distribution system.

.. image:: images/one-line-rehost-3.PNG
    :align: center

Property Tags / Quick Views
---------------------------

Now that we have equipment, we can assign them Room locations.  To do this, we will use the Property Tags.

Open the Property Tags by clicking the label icon in the top toolbar.

.. image:: images/one-line-property-tags-1.PNG
    :align: center

Under Quick Views, select Voltage Drop.

.. image:: images/one-line-property-tags-2.PNG
    :align: center

In addition, add the Room Property Tag, and note the One-Line.  Note the conductor arrangement has already been determined based on the Load Capacity. 

.. image:: images/one-line-property-tags-3.PNG
    :align: center

For each equipment, assign a Room by clicking in the textbox.

.. image:: images/one-line-property-tags-4.PNG
    :align: center

.. image:: images/one-line-property-tags-5.PNG
    :align: center

For the Distribution board we created, MDB-1, note the length before and after we assign it a Room location.

.. image:: images/one-line-property-tags-6.PNG
    :align: center

.. image:: images/one-line-property-tags-7.PNG
    :align: center

Manual Added Length
-------------------

Distances between equipment are determined by the Architectural Elements.  If a designer would like to account for additional length, use the Manual Added Length property.

.. image:: images/one-line-property-tags-8.PNG
    :align: center

.. image:: images/one-line-property-tags-9.PNG
    :align: center

Note the Voltage Drop values as the length is changed.

.. image:: images/one-line-property-tags-10.PNG
    :align: center

Deleting / Copying Equipment
----------------------------

Instead of feeding a single load, we're going to create a Distribution Board on each floor which serves the load of that floor.  

Delete the Package from MDB-1, by selecting it and clicking the Delete symbol.

.. image:: images/one-line-delete.PNG
    :align: center

Create a distribution board on each Floor of the building and attach its respective Floor Package.

.. image:: images/one-line-copy-1.PNG
    :align: center

Change the location of MDB-1 to be located in the Utility Entrance Room and refer to the image below.

.. image:: images/one-line-copy-2.PNG
    :align: center

Select the Distribution Board, DB-1, and use CTRL + C or the Copy Icon to copy the equipment.

.. image:: images/one-line-copy-icon.PNG
    :align: center

.. image:: images/one-line-copy-3.PNG
    :align: center

The selection will highlight pink when it is copied to the clipboard.

.. image:: images/one-line-copy-4.PNG
    :align: center

Select MDB-1.  This will be the source of the copied equipment.

.. image:: images/one-line-copy-5.PNG
    :align: center

Use CTRL + V or the Paste Icon to paste the equipment.

.. image:: images/one-line-paste-icon.PNG
    :align: center

.. image:: images/one-line-copy-6.PNG
    :align: center

Repeat this process for the rest of the building.  Refer to the image below.

.. image:: images/one-line-copy-7.PNG
    :align: center

Routing Through a Riser
-----------------------

To route equipment or to offset through a Riser, add the Riser Property Tag.  Then select the equipment to be routed through a Riser, and assign it a Riser. 

.. image:: images/one-line-riser-1.PNG
    :align: center

Note the Net Length as the equipment is routed through the Riser.

.. image:: images/one-line-riser-2.PNG
    :align: center

View Schedule
-------------

To view an equipment's schedule, select the equipment, and select View Schedule.

.. image:: images/one-line-view-schedule-1.PNG

**Reporting**
=============

Studies, Pricing Report, and the PriceTracker are a few of the other reporting workspaces.

Studies allows a tabular view of common engineering reports of the model such as Voltage Drop, Short Circuit, and Loading.

Pricing Report allows the user to see a breakout of OOM estimates for the model.

.. image:: images/studies-pricing-icons.PNG
    :align: center

The PriceTracker is a tool which monitors the price of the model live.

.. image:: images/pricetracker-icon.PNG
    :align: center

Similarly, the FlagTracker is a tool which reports any violations of any applicable codes and safety standards.

.. image:: images/flagtracker-icon.PNG
    :align: center

The Issuance Log is a tool which allows the designer to create branches of their design.  Changes between branches can be monitored and compared using the ChangeTracking Workspace.

.. image:: images/issuance-log-icon.PNG
    :align: center

.. image:: images/change-tracking-icon.PNG
    :align: center

The :ref:`Codes Reference <Codes-Reference>` workspace allows the designer to view applicable reference tables to their model.
