I'm in the One-Line, how do I create equipment?
-----------------------------------------------

All equipment need to have a source of power, so make sure that a source like a Utility or Generator Exists first.  Right-click inside the :doc:`One-Line <source/quickstartguide/buildingelectricalmodel/one-line/index-one-line>`, click Add Source, then choose Utility or Generator.

If you do not know what the source is yet, create an Unhosted Equipment.  Right-click inside the workspace, and then click Add Unhosted Equipment.  Use the wizard to create the equipment.
