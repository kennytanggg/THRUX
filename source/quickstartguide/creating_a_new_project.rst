Click the Home button, and then the Add (+) button to create a new project.

Project Settings
----------------
Project Settings are a set of customizable parameters to base your design.

Default Model Parameters
------------------------
The entities or objects you will use to build your model need to have some initial or base information.  For example, to build your entire model using aluminum, select the Conductor Type from the dropdown below:

Circuit
-------
Specify the characteristics of each feeder circuit. 
For example, "Added Length" is an additional factor which is added a circuit's "Calculated Length."  Lengths are determined by equipment locations.

Calc. Settings
--------------
Specify additional calculation settings here.
For example, the Temperature Rating Threshold (NEC Table 310.15(B)) for conductors can be specified here.  The default is 110 Amps.

Auto-Sizing Filters
-------------------
Auto-Sizing Filters present designers with an option to restrict certain materials from being used in their design.
For example, if 400 kCMils are logistically not available from contractors in their region, a designer can omit this by deselecting the cable size.
Furthermore, users can also omit specific conduit sizes or breaker sizes from their design.

Flag Settings
-------------
THRUX provides code validated designs, and presents users with notifications for when their design is violating a code applicable to their project. 
Certain Flags can be ignored, or have the visibility setting omitted.

Auto-Sizing Settings
--------------------
THRUX will calculate equipment sizes automatically, but certain parameters can be excluded in the Auto-Sizing settings.  For example, if the designer would like a conduit size to remain constant or intentionally oversized to account for shaft space, deselect Conduit Size here.
