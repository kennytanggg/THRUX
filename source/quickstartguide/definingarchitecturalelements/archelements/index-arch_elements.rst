X Grid / Y Grid
---------------

X Grid and Y Grid components are used to establish a location for Rooms.  Equipment is placed inside Rooms, which are effected by point to point calculations.

Floor
-----

Floors are used for power density calculations, and to also house rooms.

Space Type
----------

Space Types are used to assign power densities to architectural entities such as Floors and Rooms.  For example, engineers perform load massing calculations in order to size their main distribution equipment.  They allocate power differently for floor loads, lighting loads, and mechanical loads.  A variety of Space Types allows the engineer to study power density requirements of the project.

Room
-----

Rooms are used to establish locations for equipment.  Based on these locations, engineers can perform their point to point calculations.  Rooms can also be packaged to create custom load packages.

Riser
-----

A Riser is an entity which is used to offset conduit routes.  By default, the length of a conduit route is determined by the the distance between the source and the load.  However, engineers are often allocated Risers, or shaft space, to house their conduits, or feeders.  The conduits are routed from their source, through the Riser, and terminate at the load.
