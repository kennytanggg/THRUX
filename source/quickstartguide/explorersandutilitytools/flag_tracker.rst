Identifying Design Flaws Using FlagTracker
------------------------------------------
Below is a small example showing a Utility source, a Distribution Board, and Motor, all in different room locations.  

The Voltage Drop Quick View is enabled, in addition to the Calculated Length and Manual Added Length Properties. 

Open the FlagTracker by clicking on the right explorer dock.  Note that the current list of flags is empty.  

Increase the Manual Added Length to 1000 for the circuit feeding the DB Distribution Board and note the list of current flags.
