Scenario Manager
----------------

The Scenario Manager can be used to model different scenarios representing the state of protective devices.  It is generally used in conjunction with the One-Line.

For example, a designer may want to perform a load flow study of their electrical system as certain protective devices are opened or closed.

Open the Scenario Manager and show the OCPDs on the One-Line.
