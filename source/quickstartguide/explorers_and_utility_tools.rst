Properties Explorer
-------------------
The Properties Explorer displays the various properties associated with the current selection.

Identifying Design Flaws Using FlagTracker
------------------------------------------
Below is a small example showing a Utility source, a Distribution Board, and Motor, all in different room locations.  

The Voltage Drop Quick View is enabled, in addition to the Calculated Length and Manual Added Length Properties. 

Open the FlagTracker by clicking on the right explorer dock.  Note that the current list of flags is empty.  

Increase the Manual Added Length to 1000 for the circuit feeding the DB Distribution Board and note the list of current flags.

Pricing
-------
The price of the model is constantly being evaluated as the design changes.  Open the Pricing Explorer to view live cost impacts.

A tabular format can be viewed by opening the Pricing Report workspace.

Branching
---------
Designers are often tasked to study different options in order to determine the best option for the owner.  

To create a branch, open the Issuance Log on the right explorer bar.  Click the branch symbol and give the branch a name.  You can create a branch off the current model, or off of the last saved model.

Swap between branches by clicking the arrow symbols.  The current branch is noted in the top right navigation bar.  A branching map is displayed at the bottom of the Issuance Log.

In addition, designers can compare changes between branches, by using the Change Tracking workspace.

Change Tracking
---------------
To compare changes between branches, select the branch to compare against the current branch.  Select the entities to compare against, and select Refresh.  This list can be exported to .CSV (Excel).

Studies
-------
The Studies workspace is intended for use as a reporting tool.  

Designers can navigate through different study types like Voltage Drop, Short Circuit, and Loading.  Designers can also navigate to different workspaces to gain better perspective on their system.  

For example, a user can identify the cause of a voltage drop issue by navigating from the Studies workspace to the One-Line, Riser, or Floor Plans.
