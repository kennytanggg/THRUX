Flag Settings
-------------

THRUX provides code validated designs, and presents users with notifications for when their design is violating a code applicable to their project. 

Certain Flags can be ignored, or have the visibility setting omitted.

* Normal Priority Voltage Drop Threshold

  A flag is raised when the VD Net % for a piece of distribution equipment exceeds a specified %.  The default value is 2%.  The default threshol for end of line equipment is 5%.

* Non-Normal Priorty Voltage Drop Threshold

  A flag is raised when the VD Net % for a piece of non-normal distribution equipment, such as a generator or other secondary source of power, exceeds a specified %.  The default value is 2%.  The default threshol for end of line equipment is 5%.

* Name

  A flag is raised when a piece of equipment does not have a name.  Deselect to omit this flag.

* Breaker Undersized

  A flag is raised when a breaker's trip setting is smaller than it's frame size.

* Frame Undersized

  A flag is raised when an OCPD's Frame Size will not accommodate the associated load.  

* KAIC Undersized

  A flag is raised when the AIC rating of an equipment will not accommodate the Net SCC value. 

* Sets Per

  A flag is raised when the current amount of sets of conductors will not accommodate the load.

* Phase Undersized

  A flag is raised when the phase size of a conductor will not accommodate the load.

* Ground Undersized

  A flag is raised when a the size of the ground conductor will not accommodate the load. 

* Conduit Undersized

  A flag is raised when the maximum fill ratio of the conductor arrangement is exceeded.

* Voltage Drop Error

  A flag is raised when the Net VD % is exceeded. 

* Neutral Provision

  A flag is raised when the neutral conductor is undersized.  

* Equipment Overloaded

  A flag is raised when a piece of distribution equipment is overloaded.  
  
* Equipment Voltage Drop Error

  A flag is raised when the Net VD % exceeds the threshold value.
