General Navigation Overview
===========================

The left side toolbar is also known as the Workspace Toolbar.  Workspaces can be hosted on different windows by dragging them outside of THRUX's main window.  Bring these windows back into THRUX by clicking Dock in the top right.

#####################
Electrical Workspaces
#####################

The top 3 workspaces, :doc:`buildingelectricalmodel/one-line/index-one-line`, :doc:`buildingelectricalmodel/riser/index-riser`, and :doc:`buildingelectricalmodel/schedules/index-schedules`, are the main electrical workspaces to build your distribution system.

########################
Architectural Workspaces
########################

The next 2 workspaces, :doc:`definingarchitecturalelements/archelements/index-arch_elements`, and :ref:`Floor Plans <Floor-Plans-Overview>`, are mainly used to create the spatial elements which engulf or provide the structure to support your distribution system.  These spatial elements will drive distances between equipment, which effect electrical calculations.

#######
Studies
#######

The next workspace, :doc:`utilityworkspaces/studies/index-studies`, is used as a reporting mechanism for different study types your design.

#######
Pricing
#######

:doc:`utilityworkspaces/pricingreport/index-pricing_report` and :doc:`utilityworkspaces/equipmentrates/index-equipment_rates`, allow you to analyze the price of your design, and customize costs of materials and labor rates.

#####
Codes
#####

:doc:`utilityworkspaces/codesreference/index-codes_reference` allows designers to view various reference tables, or industry standards.

###############
Change Tracking
###############

:doc:`utilityworkspaces/changetracking/index-change_tracking` allows designers to compare branches of issuances.  Results can be exported to an Excel document, by using Copy/Paste.
