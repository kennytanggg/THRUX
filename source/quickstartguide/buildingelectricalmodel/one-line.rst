================

Toggle the visibility settings of OCPD's by hitting Show OCPD.

Load Calculations
=================

############
Normal
############

Calculations are based on the Net Load.

###############
Board Capacity
###############

Calculations are based on the capacity of the board.

##############
Load Override
##############

Calculations are based on the Load Override value.  For example, if a designer wants to model a specific loading scenario between points in their distribution system, enter these loading values into Load Override.

Property Tags / Quick Views
===========================

Use Property Tags to view and edit specific elements of your design.  Click the tag symbol in the upper left of the workspace toolbar.  

Quick Views are preset property groupings such as Voltage Drop, Loading, Load Diversification, and Circuit Routing. 

Expanding / Collapsing Equipment
================================

Sections of the distribution network can be expanded or collapsed on an individual or group basis.  

One-Line View Selectors
=======================

Different Views can be applied to aid the designer.  

By default, Normal is selected.  

Isolated Systems is recommended when viewing transfer switches.  The designer can study voltage drop as a switch is fed from different sources.

Load Flow is recommended when studying how a system is loaded.
