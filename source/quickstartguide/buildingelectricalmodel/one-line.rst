Load Calculations
-----------------
* Normal - Calculations are based on the Net Load.

* Board Capacity - Calculations are based on the capacity of the board.

* Overridden Loads - Calculations are based on the Load Override value.  For example, if a designer wants to model a specific loading scenario between points in their distribution system, enter these loading values into Load Override.

Property Tags / Quick Views
