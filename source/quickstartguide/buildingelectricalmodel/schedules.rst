Schedules are a tabular representation of your distribution system.  Schedules are primarily used for Distribution Boards, Switchboards, and Panelboards.  Not every piece of equipment has a dedicated schedule.  For example, end of line equipment such as motors do not have schedules.

The top portion of the workspace shows all open schedules.  Schedules can be exported to .csv or .dwg formats.

Specify board options like ground bus, isolated ground bus, etc., by clicking inside the textbox.  Additional options for breakers can also be specified.

Other circuit properties like OCPD and conductor sizes are calculated based on the load.

Open Schedule

Delete Equipment
----------------
To delete equipment, select the circuit number.  Click Delete (Trash Symbol) or use DEL to delete. 

Reset to Code Minimum
---------------------
If circuit properties are manually modified and generate flags, a designer can reset the circuit properties to be the code minimum value.  Select the circuit number, then click Reset to Code Minimum (Wand Symbol).

Edit Properties
---------------
Select a circuit number, and then click the Edit Properties (Gear Symbol) to open the Properties Explorer.

Reset to Code Minimum
---------------------
If circuit properties are manually modified and generate flags, a designer can reset the circuit properties to be the code minimum value.  Select the circuit number, then click Reset to Code Minimum (Wand Symbol).

Reordering Circuits
-------------------
The ordering of circuits can affect the overall construction of the board.  To move circuits, select the circuit number, and then click and drag the grip icon.

Lock / Unlock
