In order to deliver the best possible product, or construct the best building, Owners and Architects explore multitudes of design options, and Engineers are tasked with ensuring each design is safe and stable.  There is an increasing demand for professionals to rapidly respond to design changes, while still preserving quality.

Engineering tools have been scattered from paper, to spreadsheets, to analysis software, to drafting tools, and finally to the ultimate deliverable of printed drawings.  The lack of continuity between tools causes inefficiencies, which ultimately is paid by the Owner.

THRUX is a design environment aimed to unite engineering tools of the construction industry to provide a consistent, transparent, and flexible design.
