Studies
-------
The Studies workspace is intended for use as a reporting tool.  

Designers can navigate through different study types like Voltage Drop, Short Circuit, and Loading.  Designers can also navigate to different workspaces to gain better perspective on their system.  

For example, a user can identify the cause of a voltage drop issue by navigating from the Studies workspace to the One-Line, Riser, or Floor Plans.
