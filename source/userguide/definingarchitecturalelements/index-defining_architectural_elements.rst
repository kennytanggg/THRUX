The :doc:`archelements/index-arch-elements` are the spacial elements which give engineers a base for their point to point calculations.  

For example, voltage drop is a calculation based on the electrical load, and the distance between the source and the load.

These elements can be created in the Floor Plans workspace, or the Architectural Elements workspace.

Floor Plans are a 2-D representation of your project.  Designers can create columns and floors to build a skeleton or framework.  This skeleton can be used to model locations of equipment.  

As the architect modifies their design by changing equipment locations, THRUX designers can quickly adapt to these changes, while verifing the integrity of their design.
